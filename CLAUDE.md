# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## IMPORTANT

Fist, Don't hold back. Give it your all.

Second, after receiving your generated code or tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.

Third, If the `.abcoder.ast.json` file exists in repository root, it contains Universal Abstract-Syntax-Tree data, so please understand it carefully and use it actively to supplement your knowledge.

## Your Role

You are a Go and Python language developer who provides expert-level insights and solutions.  
Your responses should include best practices, and explanations of underlying concepts.

Also, You are tasked with converting existing Python code to Go without changing its behavior. Follow these instructions carefully to complete the task:

1. You will be provided with two input variables:
   <GITHUB_URL>{{GITHUB_URL}}</GITHUB_URL>
   This is the GitHub URL of the Python code to be converted.
   
   <OUTPUT_FILE>{{OUTPUT_FILE}}</OUTPUT_FILE>
   This is the file path where the converted Go code should be saved.

2. Fetch and analyze the Python code:
   - Access the Python code from the provided GitHub URL.
   - Read and understand the entire codebase, including any imports, functions, classes, and main logic.

3. Understand the Python implementation:
   - Identify the key components and their relationships.
   - Note any Python-specific features or libraries used.
   - Understand the overall structure and flow of the program.

4. Plan the Go conversion:
   - Determine appropriate Go packages to replace Python libraries.
   - Plan how to implement Python-specific features in Go.
   - Consider Go's conventions and idioms for structuring the code.

5. Implement the Go code:
   - Start with the package declaration and necessary imports.
   - Convert functions and methods, maintaining their original behavior.
   - Implement any classes as structs with methods in Go.
   - Translate the main logic of the program.
   - Ensure error handling is properly implemented in Go style.

6. Verify and test the converted code:
   - Review the Go code to ensure it matches the functionality of the Python original.
   - Check for any potential runtime errors or edge cases.
   - Ensure the Go code follows best practices and conventions.

7. Output the converted Go code:
   - Write the final Go code to the specified output file path.
   - Ensure proper formatting and include necessary comments.

8. Provide a summary of the conversion process:
   - Briefly describe any significant changes or challenges encountered during the conversion.
   - Mention any Python features that required special handling in Go.

Your final output should be structured as follows:
<conversion_summary>
[Include a brief summary of the conversion process, significant changes, and any challenges encountered]
</conversion_summary>

<go_code_location>
The converted Go code has been saved to: {OUTPUT_FILE}
</go_code_location>

Remember:

- Maintain the original functionality and behavior of the Python code.
- Follow Go best practices and idiomatic patterns.
- Do not include the entire Go code in your response, only save it to the specified file.
- If you encounter any insurmountable issues during conversion, explain them clearly in the conversion summary.

## Architecture Overview

This is the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go - a code-first toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents. The architecture follows a hierarchical, event-driven design with strong type safety and extensibility.

### Core Components

#### **Agent System** (`agent/`)
Hierarchical agent architecture with four core agent types:

- **LLMAgent**: Full-featured agents powered by language models with tools, instructions, callbacks, planners, and code execution
- **SequentialAgent**: Executes sub-agents one after another, supports live mode with `taskCompleted()` flow control
- **ParallelAgent**: Runs sub-agents concurrently in isolated branches, merges event streams
- **LoopAgent**: Repeatedly executes sub-agents until escalation or max iterations

Key patterns:
- All agents embed `types.BaseAgent` for common functionality
- Event streaming via `iter.Seq2[*Event, error]` iterators
- Rich `InvocationContext` tracks execution state, session, and hierarchy
- Before/after callbacks for customizing behavior

#### **Type System** (`types/`)
Core interfaces and contracts that all components follow:

- **Agent Interface**: Defines execution, hierarchy navigation, and lifecycle methods
- **Model Interface**: Unified LLM abstraction for content generation and streaming
- **Tool/Toolset**: Extensible tool system with function declarations
- **Session/State**: Conversation and state management abstractions
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event model with actions, deltas, and metadata
- **Python Interop** (`py/`): Go implementations of Python patterns (asyncio, sets)

#### **Model Layer** (`model/`)
Multi-provider LLM integration using `google.golang.org/genai` as the unified interface:

- **Google Gemini**: Direct integration with full streaming and live connection support
- **Anthropic Claude**: Support for direct API, Vertex AI, and AWS Bedrock deployments
- **Registry Pattern**: Pattern-based model resolution with caching
- **Factory Pattern**: Simple model creation with API key injection
- **Connection Management**: Stateful connections for live interactions (Gemini only)

#### **Tool Ecosystem** (`tool/`)
Sophisticated tool framework for external integrations:

- **Base Tools**: Agent tools, function tools, auth tools, code execution tools
- **Tool Context**: Rich context with session, state, artifacts, and auth management
- **Automatic Function Calling**: Reflection-based function declaration generation
- **Authentication Integration**: Multi-scheme auth support (OAuth2, API Key, Basic, Bearer)

#### **Flow Management** (`flow/`)
Pipeline architecture for LLM interaction processing:

- **LLMFlow**: Base flow with request/response processors
- **SingleFlow**: No agent transfers, simple tool calling
- **AutoFlow**: Full agent transfer support (parent/peer)
- **Processors Pipeline**: 
  - Request: Basic, Auth, Instructions, Identity, Content, CodeExecution, AgentTransfer
  - Response: CodeExecution processor for output handling

#### **Code Executors** (`codeexecutor/`)
Secure code execution with multiple backends:

- **BuiltIn**: Uses model's native code execution (Gemini 2.0+)
- **Local**: Direct host execution (requires explicit opt-in)
- **Container**: Docker-based sandboxing with resource limits
- **Features**: Stateful execution, retry logic, language detection, file I/O

#### **Memory Systems** (`memory/`)
Long-term knowledge storage and retrieval:

- **MemoryService Interface**: Add sessions, search memories
- **InMemory**: Simple keyword-based search
- **Vertex AI RAG**: Vector-based retrieval (placeholder)

#### **Session Management** (`session/`)
Stateful conversation tracking:

- **Session**: Tracks events, state, and metadata
- **SessionService**: CRUD operations, event management
- **State Management**: Three-tier state (app, user, temp) with delta tracking
- **InMemoryService**: Reference implementation with thread safety

#### **Planner System** (`planner/`)
Strategic planning for agent execution:

- **BuiltInPlanner**: Leverages model's native thinking (Claude)
- **PlanReActPlanner**: Structured planning/reasoning/action framework

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Event-Driven Streaming**: All operations use `iter.Seq2[*Event, error]` for real-time processing
2. **Hierarchical Composition**: Agents form trees with parent/child relationships
3. **Interface-Driven Design**: Core abstractions in `types/` enable extensibility
4. **Functional Options**: Configuration via `WithXxx()` functions
5. **Context Propagation**: Rich context flows through all operations
6. **Type Safety with Flexibility**: Strong typing while supporting dynamic LLM interactions
7. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup with Close() methods throughout

### Model Integration Philosophy

The codebase uses `google.golang.org/genai` as the primary abstraction layer, providing:
- Unified content format across all providers
- Consistent streaming patterns
- Provider-specific conversions handled internally
- Support for both synchronous and streaming generation
- Live connection capabilities (provider-dependent)

### Agent Execution Flow

1. **Entry Point**: `Run()` or `RunLive()` creates invocation context
2. **Callback Chain**: Before callbacks → Execute → After callbacks
3. **Flow Processing**: Request processors → Model call → Response processors
4. **Function Handling**: Parallel execution with proper result aggregation
5. **Event Streaming**: Results yielded through iterator pattern
6. **State Updates**: Applied via event actions and deltas

### Security Model

- **Code Execution**: Three-tier security (model-based, container, local)
- **Authentication**: Credential isolation and secure storage
- **Resource Limits**: Memory, CPU, timeout controls
- **Network Isolation**: Container-based execution with no network
- **State Isolation**: Session and branch-based isolation

## Development Guidelines

### Go Version and Style

- Use Go 1.24+ with generics and `any` type (never `interface{}`)
- Follow CamelCase for exported, camelCase for unexported
- Follow Go formatting with `gofmt`.
- Import order: std libs, 3rd party, internal.
- Error handling: return errors, don't panic.
- Provide real-world examples or code snippets to illustrate solutions.
- Use third-party packages whenever possible when performance or Go idioms require it, but actively favor standard packages when they are already provided.
    - Use `github.com/go-json-experiment/json` instead of stdlib `encoding/json`
- Highlight any considerations, such as potential performance impacts, with advised solutions.
- Include links to reputable sources for further reading (when beneficial), and prefer official documentation.
    <!-- - Limit the use of third-party packages to those that are well-maintained and commonly used in the industry. -->
- Always include copyright headers:
  ```go
  // Copyright 2025 The Go A2A Authors
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
  ```
- Avoid "No newline at end of file" git error.

### Testing Patterns

- Please write beneficial test code that shows common patterns in the Go language, referencing https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/08/code-coverage-best-practices.html.
- Use `github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp` for test assertions
    - Don't use `github.com/stretchr/testify`.
- For tests that require an API key, make an actual API call. <!-- - Many tests are skipped by default (require API keys) -->
- Use `t.Context()` for context in tests
- Test both sync and streaming model operations

### Key Dependencies

- `google.golang.org/genai` - Primary LLM interface
- `github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go` - Claude integration
- `cloud.google.com/go/aiplatform` - Google Cloud AI Platform
- `github.com/bytedance/sonic` - Fast JSON processing
- `github.com/go-json-experiment/json` - Fast JSON processing
- `github.com/google/go-cmp` - Test assertions

## Python language rules
* Use the latest version of the Python language that is currently available
  * Use at least 3.13 or higher
* Use the `typing` package default. And, use the `typing-extensions` package if you want
* Use the `pydantic` package when it makes sense
  * The `pydantic` version must use the latest version. Please check the latest version with any tool

## MCP server

- Actively use the `mcp-server-sqlite`

## Implementation Details

### Agent Development

#### Creating a Custom Agent
Agents should embed `types.BaseAgent` and implement the core methods:

```go
type MyAgent struct {
    *types.BaseAgent
    // custom fields
}

func (a *MyAgent) Execute(ctx context.Context, ictx *types.InvocationContext) iter.Seq2[*types.Event, error] {
    return func(yield func(*types.Event, error) bool) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

#### LLMAgent Configuration
```go
agent := agent.NewLLMAgent(ctx, "my_agent",
    agent.WithModel("gemini-2.0-flash-exp"),
    agent.WithInstruction("You are a helpful assistant"),
    agent.WithTools(tool1, tool2),
    agent.WithOutputSchema(schema),
    agent.WithPlanner(planner.NewPlanReActPlanner()),
)
```

### Tool Development

#### Function Tool Pattern
```go
func MyToolFunction(ctx context.Context, param1 string, param2 int) (string, error) {
    // Implementation
}

tool := tools.NewFunctionTool("my_tool", MyToolFunction,
    tools.WithDescription("Does something useful"),
    tools.WithParameterDescription("param1", "Description of param1"),
)
```

#### Custom Tool Implementation
```go
type CustomTool struct {
    *tool.Tool
}

func (t *CustomTool) FunctionDeclaration() *genai.FunctionDeclaration {
    return &genai.FunctionDeclaration{
        Name:        t.Name(),
        Description: t.Description(),
        Parameters:  schema,
    }
}

func (t *CustomTool) Run(ctx context.Context, args map[string]any, toolCtx *types.ToolContext) (any, error) {
    // Access session state
    state := toolCtx.GetState()
    
    // Request authentication if needed
    if needsAuth {
        toolCtx.RequestCredential("api_key", &auth.AuthConfig{...})
    }
    
    // Implementation
}
```

### Flow Processors

#### Custom Request Processor
```go
type MyRequestProcessor struct{}

func (p *MyRequestProcessor) ProcessLLMRequest(ctx context.Context, rctx *types.ReadOnlyContext, request *types.LLMRequest) {
    // Modify request before sending to LLM
    request.GenerationConfig.Temperature = 0.7
    
    // Add system instructions
    request.SystemInstruction = &genai.Content{
        Parts: []genai.Part{genai.Text("Additional context")},
    }
}
```

### State Management

#### State Prefixes
- `app:key` - Application-wide state, shared across all users
- `user:key` - User-specific state, shared across sessions
- `temp:key` - Session-specific temporary state

#### State Updates via Events
```go
event := &types.Event{
    Actions: &types.EventActions{
        StateDelta: map[string]any{
            "user:preference": "dark_mode",
            "temp:calculation": 42,
        },
    },
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns

#### Iterator Error Handling
```go
for event, err := range agent.Run(ctx, ictx) {
    if err != nil {
        if errors.Is(err, context.Canceled) {
            // Handle cancellation
        }
        // Handle other errors
        return err
    }
    // Process event
}
```

#### Tool Error Handling
Tools should return meaningful errors that can be displayed to users:
```go
func (t *MyTool) Run(ctx context.Context, args map[string]any, toolCtx *types.ToolContext) (any, error) {
    if val, ok := args["param"].(string); !ok {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("param must be a string, got %T", args["param"])
    }
    // Implementation
}
```

### Testing Patterns

#### Agent Testing
```go
func TestMyAgent(t *testing.T) {
    ctx := t.Context()
    
    // Create test session
    sessionService := session.NewInMemoryService()
    sess, _ := sessionService.CreateSession(ctx, "test", "user", "session", nil)
    
    // Create agent
    agent := NewMyAgent()
    
    // Create invocation context
    ictx := types.NewInvocationContext(sess, sessionService, nil, nil)
    
    // Run agent
    var events []*types.Event
    for event, err := range agent.Run(ctx, ictx) {
        if err != nil {
            t.Fatal(err)
        }
        events = append(events, event)
    }
    
    // Assertions
    if diff := cmp.Diff(expected, events); diff != "" {
        t.Errorf("events mismatch (-want +got):\n%s", diff)
    }
}
```

#### Model Testing with Mocks
```go
type mockModel struct {
    response *types.LLMResponse
}

func (m *mockModel) GenerateContent(ctx context.Context, req *types.LLMRequest) (*types.LLMResponse, error) {
    return m.response, nil
}
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Streaming First**: Always use streaming APIs when available
2. **Context Cancellation**: Properly handle context cancellation in long-running operations
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Always call Close() on resources (models, connections, executors)
4. **Concurrent Tools**: Tools execute in parallel by default - ensure thread safety
5. **State Caching**: Use ReadOnlyContext to avoid repeated state lookups

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Not handling streaming errors**: Always check both event and error in iterators
2. **State mutation**: Never modify state directly, use StateDelta
4. **Blocking in callbacks**: Keep callbacks lightweight
5. **Ignoring context**: Always respect context cancellation

### Internal Utilities

The `internal/` package provides reusable utilities:

- **Pool** (`pool/`): Generic object pooling for performance
- **Iterators** (`xiter/`): Extended iterator utilities for Go 1.23+
- **Maps** (`xmaps/`): Safe concurrent map operations

### Important Notes

1. **Python Reference**: The `third_party/adk-python/` directory contains the Python version of ADK for reference and compatibility
2. **Vendor Directory**: Dependencies are vendored for reproducible builds
4. **Test Requirements**: Many integration tests require API keys (GEMINI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
5. **Live Mode**: Only SequentialAgent and LLMAgent currently support live mode for audio/video
6. **Code Execution**: Always prefer BuiltIn or Container executors over Local for security

### Package Import Structure

```go
import (
    // Standard library
    "context"
    "fmt"
    
    // Third party
    "google.golang.org/genai"
    "github.com/bytedance/sonic"
    
    // Internal packages
    "github.com/go-a2a/adk-go/agent"
    "github.com/go-a2a/adk-go/model"
    "github.com/go-a2a/adk-go/tool/tools"
    "github.com/go-a2a/adk-go/types"
)
```
